# GrowHome
## Inspiration
Have you ever thought about buying a house but were frightened by the huge interest rates ? 
Have you ever wondered at the end of the month how you spent so much and you never realised it ? 
With the financial and war crisis ,It is becoming harder and harder for people to pay for a house . 
With GrowHome, People will get the opportunity to visualise their spendings as well  as their savings and be encouraged to put more money aside so they can afford their dream house. 
## What it does
GrowHome is a web page where the user can track their savings and visualize how much they need to save in order to afford their dream house . 
The more they save , the faster the house will be built .
## How we built it
we used the framework React and build our house Java Script using data provided by the api of interhyp . 
## Challenges we ran into
Finding out how to get the appropriate properties we needed for our web page . 
Lack of knowledge in the financial industry. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
 Having a pretty UI and finding a new home for sammy. 
 
 Good team work spirit .
 
 Pulling in the all nighter to submit a working prototype. 
 
 Having fun and learning something new .
## What we learned
we learned : 

Fast prototyping techniques.

Continuous integration. 

Splitting the work. 

Stress management. 
## What's next for GrowHome
GrowHome has a lot of potential . Data can be downloaded automatically from the user 's account and categorized so the user doesn't have to 
put it manually . There also would be an estimation of when a person will be able to pay for the equity cash based on the infromation provided on their saving . User can also have an investment section where thy can visualise which stocks they invested in and their profit . Some unsual income like inheritance ,selling a property can also be taken into account to track how much does the user has to save after receiving this unplanned amount of money .
