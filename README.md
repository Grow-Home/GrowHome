# GrowHome
## Inspiration
Have you ever thought about buying a house but were frightened by the huge interest rates ? 
With the financial and war crisis ,It is becoming harder and harder for people to pay for a house . 
With GrowHome, People will get the opportunity to visualise their spendings and be encouraged to put more money aside so they can afford their dream house. 
## What it does
GrowHome is a web application with elements of gamification that helps people to track their savings and visualize how much they still need to save in order to afford their dream house . 
The more they save , the faster they will be house will be built .
## How we built it
The application is built in JavaScript with the React framework. The Python was used to receive data from Interhyp API. 
## Challenges we ran into
Adding a new value into existing Interhyb functionality.

Lack of knowledge in the financial industry. 

Strict time constraints
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
 Having a pretty UI and finding a new home for Sammy. 
 
 Good team work spirit .
 
 Pulling in the all nighter to submit a working prototype. 
 
 Having fun and learning something new .
## What we learned
we learned : 

Fast prototyping techniques.

Continuous integration. 

Splitting the work. 

Improved our Javascript skills

Stress management. 
## What's next for GrowHome
GrowHome has a lot of potential . Data can be downloaded automatically from the user 's bank account and categorized so the user doesn't have to 
put it manually . There also would be an estimation of when a person will be able to pay for the equity cash based on the infromation provided on their saving . User can also have an investment section where thy can visualise which stocks they invested in and their profit . Some unsual income like inheritance ,selling a property can also be taken into account to track how much does the user has to save after receiving this unplanned amount of money .
